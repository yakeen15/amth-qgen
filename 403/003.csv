1,"Find the mass of the atmosphere."
2,"Find the mass of troposphere."
3,"At approximately what height above sea level does half of the mass of the atmosphere lie above and other half lie below? Assume $H=8$km and neglect the small vertical variation of $g$ with height."
4,"Assume exponential pressure and dnesity dependence with scale height $7.5$km. Estimate the heights of the atmosphere at which \\(a) the ar density is equal to $1kgm^{-3}$\\(b)the height at which the pressure is equal to $1$hPa."
