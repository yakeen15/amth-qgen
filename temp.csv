401/002_1,"Let $(X,T)$ be a TS. Then prove that the class of closed subsets $F$ of $X$ possesses the following properties\\(i) $X$ and $\phi$ are closed (both belong to $F$)\\(ii) The intersection of any family of sets in $T$ belongs to F\\ (iii) The union of any two sets in $F$ belongs to $F$."
401/002_2,"Let $(X,T)$ be a TS, and $A\subseteq X$, then\\(i)$\stackrel{\circ}{A}$ is an open set\\(ii)$\stackrel{\circ}{A}$ is the largest open set contained $A$\\(iii)$A$ is open if and only if $\stackrel{\circ}{A}=A$"
