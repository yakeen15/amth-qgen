3,"A viscous fluid is initially at rest between two infinite planes at $y=0,h$. At time $t=0$ the plane at $y=h$ is set in motion implusively so that it has constant velocity $U$ in the x-direction for $t>0$. Show that after the impulse the velocity in the fluid is \[\frac{Uy}{h}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^nsin(\frac{n\pi y}{h})exp(-\frac{n^2\pi^2}{h^2}\nu t)\]"
