10,"A viscometer is constructed with two 30 cm long concentric clyinders, one 20 cm in diameter and the other 20.2 cm in diameter. A torque of 0.13 Nm is required to rotat the inner cylinder at 400 rpm. Calculate the viscosity."
11,"The viscosity of a fluid is to be measured by a viscometer constructed of two 5 ft long concentric cylinders. The inner diameter of the outer cylinder is 6 in and the gap between the two cylinders is 0.035 in, The outer cylinder is rotated at 250 rpm, and the torque is measured to be 1.2lbf$\cdot$ft. Determine the viscosity of the fluid."
