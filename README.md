AMTH401 : Applied Analysis  

AMTH402 : Fluid Dynamics  

AMTH403 : Physical Meteorology  

AMTH405 : Differential Geometry and Tensor Analysis  

AMTH406 : Asymptotic Analysis and Perturbation Methods  

AMTH407 : Stochastic Calculus  

AMTH409 : Actuarial Mathematics  

Courses that will be supported in the future  

AMTH404 : Hydrology  

AMTH417 : Biomechanics  

AMTH418 : Mathematical Models for Machine Learning  

The questions generated do not cover the whole syllabus and is a work in development.
