1,"Find the first few terms of a suitable asymptotic approximation to the large positive root of the transcendental equation \[xtanx=1\]"
2,"Find the first two terms of a suitable asymptotic approximation to the large positive root of the transcendental equation \[xcotx=1\]"
3,"Asymptotic expansion for bessel's function $J_0(x)$ for large $x$ is \[ J_0(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \left[ \frac{1}{x^{1/2}} \cos\left(x-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \frac{1}{8x^{3/2}} \sin\left(x-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right] - \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \left[ \frac{9}{128x^{5/2}} \cos\left(x-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \frac{75}{1024x^{7/2}} \sin\left(x-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right] \]It can be shown that large root of this is approximated by \[x=(n+3/4)\pi+\frac{1}{2\pi(4n+3)}+\cdots\]"
